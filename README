Edit these files to write facts and rules that define the given predicates:
problem1.pl
problem2.pl
problem3.pl
problem4.pl
problem5.pl
problem6.pl
problem7.pl
Do not modify the predicate signatures or file names.
However, you may modify the given parameters to use pattern matching.

You can enter these commands to test your predicates using the provided test cases:
gprolog < run1.pl
gprolog < run2.pl
gprolog < run3.pl
gprolog < run4.pl
gprolog < run5.pl
gprolog < run6.pl
gprolog < run7.pl
Also you can add more test cases to these files.

These test files use Prolog's predefined predicate setof.
Both findall(V,Q,L) and setof(V,Q,L) yield a list L that contains all the possible values of
variable V in answers to query Q.
The difference is that setof removes any duplicates from L, and also rearranges L into sorted order.
This way the grading script can award credit for correct solutions even if your predicate returns
each answer multiple times or in an unexpected order.

Example:
setof(X, member(X,[c,b,a,d,b,f,d,f,e]), Answers) yields Answers = [a,b,c,d,e,f].
